        Initialize a new Perceptron instance.

        A perceptron classifies data points as either belonging to a particular
        class (+1) or not (-1). `dimensions` is the dimensionality of the data.
        For example, dimensions=2 would mean that the perceptron must classify
        2D points.

        In order for our autograder to detect your weight, initialize it as a 
        pytorch Parameter object as follows:

        Parameter(weight_vector)

        where weight_vector is a pytorch Tensor of dimension 'dimensions'
